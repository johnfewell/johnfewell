### Hi there 👋

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in Typescript and Angular. 

[You can find my StackOverflow profile here.](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10480323/meqwz?tab=profile)

I've made various open-source contributions, including to Elf, the reactive immutable state management solution built on RxJS. 

Features Contributed:

- [🔥 Add ttl to updateRequestsCache](https://github.com/ngneat/elf/pull/477)
- [🔥 Add an option to control future state](https://github.com/ngneat/elf/pull/475)

I also blog about programming. A recent post:
